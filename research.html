        Virtual acoustics encompasses spatial audio and environmental acoustics technologies. Spatial audio 
        technologies place virtual sounds in three dimensions using binaural or multichannel methods 
        while enviromental acoustics technologies incorporate the sound properties of 
        a physical space into an audio signal. In my research, I build  
        physics-based simulations of spatialized sound and 
        enviromental acoustics in order to improve these technologies.

        <div style="LINE-HEIGHT:18px; text-align:left"><font color="grey">Physical modeling sound synthesis is a numerical technique that generates sound from 
        mathematical descriptions of acoustic systems. Compared to abstract methods of sound synthesis, such as additive, wavetable, 
        and FM synthesis, physical modeling sound synthesis appears to be superior for producing more physically accurate sound and 
        offering more intuitive user control. With abstract methods, several control parameters must be tuned 
        correctly in order to create physically accurate sound. Physical modeling methods, on the other hand, typically contain  
        fewer control parameters and thus are easier to configure correctly. Moreover, since users are generally more familiar with physical 
        control parameters (e.g. object size and material properties) than they are with abstract control parameters (e.g. the 
        indices of frequency modulation), they can more easily predict the effect that each parameter will have on the 
        sound.</font></div>

          In my research, I primarily focus on developing sound synthesis
        algorithms for music, animation, virtual reality, and other application areas.

          My primary research interest is in developing sound synthesis
        algorithms for computer music, computer animation, and other application areas.

          I am actively involved in researching sound synthesis
        algorithms for computer music, computer animation, and other application areas.
          
          ... while may be desirable for achieving a particular aesthetic, is nonetheless unmistakably artificial. 

          Physical modeling sound synthesis is a numerical approach for generating mechanical vibration from mathematical descriptions 
        of acoustic systems.

        In regards to accuracy, abstract synthesis produces sound that, while may be desirable for achieving a 
        particular aesthetic, is often perceived as artificial.

        In regards to accuracy, abstract synthesis often produces unnatural sound.

          This may be due to the fact that abstract methods typically require the specification of 
        many control parameters which, if mismatched in any way with the waveforms they hope to reproduce, will create unnatural output. 

        Physical modeling methods, on the other hand, contain fewer 
        control parameters and thus may lead to more physically accurate sound.

        <!-- <a href="graphics"><h5><b>Computer Graphics and Optics</b></h5></a>

        <div style="LINE-HEIGHT:18px; text-align:left"><font color="grey">I first became interested in optics research as 
          a graduate student in physics. At that time, I performed experiments to demonstrate how light can trap 
          fluid particles in two-dimensional corrals. Aside from being a novel contribution to the field of optics, the 2D optical 
          corral is also a useful geometry for studying the underlying nature of 
          the trapped particles' surrounding fluid, which is important for understanding microfluidic devices used in biology, 
          chemistry, and medicine. While still retaining my interest in optics, I have switched my focus to computer 
          graphics research, which complements my work in sound synthesis for computer animation.  -->
          
          
          <!--

            My interest in computer graphics and optics originated with graduate 
          research I conducted on optical trapping

          My graduate advisor, Keith Bonin, and I were the first to experimentally 
          demonstrate that a light beam could trap fluid-immersed particles in 2D optical corrals

            Of particular interest to me during those years was the pecular nature of light, specifically 
          its ability to trap small particles when the light is sufficiently powerful.
            
            At that time, I was enrolled in a master's program in physics and determined to 
          embark on a career in basic science research.
        
          I am in the very early stages of this research, and I hope to report results soon.

        <div style="LINE-HEIGHT:18px; text-align:left"><font color="grey">As music production and recording has become more prevalent in 
          home studios&mdash;which have limited budgets and physical space constraints&mdash;the demand for digital emulations of popular 
          analog effects found in expensive, bulky audio gear has risen tremendously. Moreover, the demand for original audio effects 
          remains high. In my work, I have developed physically-modeled analog circuit effects as well as original fluid sonification effects. -->

          <!-- 

            In my research, I have developed physically-modeled analog circuit effects and fluid sonification effects.

            In my research, I have mainly focused on physically-modeled audio effects, including state-space modeled analog 
          circuit effects and fluid sonification effects.

            In my research, I focus mainly on state-space modeling of analog circuit effects and data sonification effects.

            My research has focused on a variety of digital emulations of analog effects, including 
          synthesizer filters, vacuum tube amplifiers, and delay effects. Up to this point, I have mostly studied state-space models of circuit 
          simulation. In addition to analog effects modeling, I have developed other digital audio effects, including phase vocoders and 
          stochastic effects. 

          I am especially drawn to fluid dynamics sonification and state-space modeling of analog circuits.

        <div style="LINE-HEIGHT:18px; text-align:left"><font color="grey"> I am currently working on a computer program to generate a continuous stream of Brownian position data for 
          real-time sonification and manipulation. In a model based on the equation of motion of an optically-ordered Brownian particle, the 
          composer could adjust the parameters of the Brownian audio effect by altering the physical parameters of the particle, the Brownian 
          trap, or the background fluid environment. Increasing the transverse irradiance gradient of the laser, for example, would make the 
          particle more likely to reside in the centermost sub-region and less likely to escape the trap. Such a change would increase the 
          stability of the lowest-frequency note and reduce the likelihood of higher-pitched, stochastic sequences. Increasing the fluid viscosity, 
          moreover, would slow the particle’s average velocity, effectively increasing the duration over which notes were played. Data-mapping 
          algorithms could also be incorporated into the model to manipulate the sampling rate and mapping areas in real time.</font></div>
