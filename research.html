          I have developed mathematical and computational methods for handling open exterior boundaries in acoustic wave 
          simulation, including a differential geometric method that solves the wave equation in infinite 
          spacetime and a discrete perfectly matched layer that exhibits machine-zero reflections. Future
          directions of my research involve developing boundary flattening methods for curved obstacles and formulating a

          theme in this work is the discovery of conformally invariant transformations of wave propagation, an
          approach that derives from Felix Klein's Erlangen program. Application areas may include architectural acoustic design, 
          personalized binaural audio, audio device prototyping, and geophysical simulation. Image caption (left to right): solution to the Helmhotz

          Virtual acoustics encompasses spatial audio and artificial reverberation. Spatial audio  
        places virtual sounds in three dimensions using binaural or multichannel methods 
        while artificial reverberation incorporates the sound properties of

          physics-based descriptions of empirical observations

          Physical modeling sound synthesis is a numerical technique that generates sound from mathematical descriptions of acoustic systems. 
          Compared to abstract methods of sound synthesis, such as additive, wavetable, and FM synthesis, physical modeling sound synthesis 
          is superior at producing more physically accurate sound and arguably better at offering more intuitive user control. I am especially 
          interested in variational methods for modeling fluid-structure interactions in musical instruments and human hearing as well as surface 
          waves in liquids and elastic membranes.

          With abstract methods, several control parameters must be tuned 
        correctly in order to create physically accurate sound. Physical modeling methods, on the other hand, typically contain  
        fewer control parameters and thus are easier to configure correctly. Moreover, since users are generally more familiar with physical 
        control parameters (e.g. object size and material properties) than they are with abstract control parameters (e.g. the 
        indices of frequency modulation), they can more easily predict the effect that each parameter will have on the 
        sound. 

          appears to be superior
          
          In my research, I primarily focus on developing sound synthesis
        algorithms for music, animation, and virtual reality. I am particularly drawn to physical modeling 
        techniques for sound synthesis.  -->

          Physical modeling sound synthesis is a numerical approach for generating mechanical vibration from mathematical descriptions 
        of acoustic systems.

        In regards to accuracy, abstract synthesis produces sound that, while may be desirable for achieving a 
        particular aesthetic, is often perceived as artificial.

        In regards to accuracy, abstract synthesis often produces unnatural sound.

          This may be due to the fact that abstract methods typically require the specification of 
        many control parameters which, if mismatched in any way with the waveforms they hope to reproduce, will create unnatural output. 

        Physical modeling methods, on the other hand, contain fewer 
        control parameters and thus may lead to more physically accurate sound.

        <div style="LINE-HEIGHT:18px; text-align:left"><font color="#686A6C">I first became interested in optics research as 
          a graduate student in physics. At that time, I performed experiments to demonstrate how light can trap

          corral is also a useful geometry for studying the underlying nature of 
          the trapped particles' surrounding fluid, which is important for understanding microfluidic devices used in biology, 
          chemistry, and medicine. While still retaining my interest in optics, I have switched my focus to computer 
          graphics research, which complements my work in sound synthesis for computer animation.  -->


      <!--

            My interest in computer graphics and optics originated with graduate 
          research I conducted on optical trapping

          My graduate advisor, Keith Bonin, and I were the first to experimentally 
          demonstrate that a light beam could trap fluid-immersed particles in 2D optical corrals

            Of particular interest to me during those years was the pecular nature of light, specifically 
          its ability to trap small particles when the light is sufficiently powerful.
            
            At that time, I was enrolled in a master's program in physics and determined to 
          embark on a career in basic science research.
        
          I am in the very early stages of this research, and I hope to report results soon.

          real-time sonification and manipulation. In a model based on the equation of motion of an optically-ordered Brownian particle, the 
          composer could adjust the parameters of the Brownian audio effect by altering the physical parameters of the particle, the Brownian 
          trap, or the background fluid environment. Increasing the transverse irradiance gradient of the laser, for example, would make the

          stability of the lowest-frequency note and reduce the likelihood of higher-pitched, stochastic sequences. Increasing the fluid viscosity, 
          moreover, would slow the particle’s average velocity, effectively increasing the duration over which notes were played. Data-mapping
